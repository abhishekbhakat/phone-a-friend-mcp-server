    copy-paste into external AI interfaces. It uses the same prompt structure as the
    phone_a_friend tool but requires manual intervention to get the AI response.

    Use this tool when:
    - The automated phone_a_friend tool is unavailable
    - You want to manually control which AI service to use
    - You need to consult multiple AI services with the same prompt
    - API access is limited or unavailable

    The tool generates a file that you can manually copy and paste into any AI interface.

NEXT STEPS - Please follow these instructions:

1. 📂 Open the file: {file_path}
2. 📋 Copy the ENTIRE prompt content from the file
3. 🤖 Paste it into your preferred AI chat interface (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.)
4. ⏳ Wait for the AI's response
5. 📝 Copy the AI's complete response
6. 🔄 Return to this conversation and provide the AI's response

The prompt is ready for any external AI service. Simply copy and paste the entire content.

💡 TIP: You can use the same prompt with multiple AI services to compare responses!
